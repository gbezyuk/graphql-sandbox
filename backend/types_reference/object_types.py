"""
`first_name` and `last_name` are fields of the `ObjectType`.
Each field is specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a Field.

The above `Person` ObjectType has the following schema representation:

type Person {
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  fullName: String
}

Graphene ObjectTypes can act as containers too. So with the previous example you could do:

peter = Person(first_name='Peter', last_name='Griffin')

peter.first_name # prints "Peter"
peter.last_name # prints "Griffin"
